# Here is the Assignment(3) Array_HW for lecture 4 it has 5 exercises

## 1.Solving EX1:Example of Multidimensional Array In C

Write a C program to find sum of two matrix of order 2* 2 using multidimensional arrays where, elements of matrix are entered by user.

### Ouput


	Enter the elements of 1st matrix
	
	Enter all: 2;
	Enter a12: 0.5;
	Enter a21: -1.1;
	Enter a22: 2;
	
	Enter the elements of 2nd matrix
	
	Enter bll: 0.2;
	Enter b12: 0;
	Enter b21: 0.23;
	Enter b22: 23;
	
	Sum Of Matrix:
	2.2    0.5
	-0.9   25.0
	
solved

## 2.Solving EX2:C Program to Calculate Average Using Arrays

This program takes n number of element from user(where, n is specified by user), stores data in an array and calculates the average of those numbers.

### Ouput


	Enter the numbers of data : 6
	1. Enter number : 45.3
	2. Enter number : 67.5
	3. Enter number : -45.6
	4. Enter number : 20.34
	5. Enter number : 33
	6. Enter number : 45.6
